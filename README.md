# Website Performance Analysis Dashboard – Case Study

## Project Overview

This project is a website performance analysis dashboard developed using Power BI. It provides a comprehensive and interactive visualization of key website metrics to help organizations understand user behavior and identify areas for strategic improvement. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly for stakeholders without technical backgrounds, allowing them to make informed decisions based on visual insights.

## Problem Statement

Despite steady web traffic, the organization lacked clarity on how users were engaging with the website across different traffic sources and geographic locations. Key business questions remained unanswered, such as:

- Which traffic sources deliver the most engaged users?
- Are specific regions or user groups underperforming?
- What is contributing to the high bounce rate and how can conversion be improved?

There was a clear need for a visual analytics tool that could consolidate this information and highlight actionable insights.

## Methodology

To address the problem, the project followed a structured approach combining Python for data preparation and Power BI for visualization.

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Used Python libraries, specifically Pandas and NumPy, to clean, organize, and structure the raw dataset.
   - Handled missing values, standardized data formats, and ensured consistent naming for traffic sources (e.g., Organic, Paid, Referral, Social, Direct).
   - Grouped and aggregated data by country to enable comparative analysis across regions.
   - Exported the cleaned dataset for integration into Power BI.

2. **Dashboard Development with Power BI**
   - Imported the prepared dataset into Power BI Desktop.
   - Created interactive visuals including bar charts, column charts, and summary KPI cards to represent core metrics such as bounce rate, page views, session duration, time on page, and conversion rate.
   - Developed DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas to calculate aggregated values and derive insights.
   - Implemented slicers and filters for real-time exploration of traffic source and regional performance.

3. **Insight Extraction**
   - Explored relationships between user behavior metrics and geographic or channel-based performance.
   - Identified which traffic sources and countries had the highest engagement and conversions, as well as those with lower performance needing attention.

## Results and Key Insights

- **Bounce Rate**: The average bounce rate was 569.53, which is significantly high. This was especially evident for visitors arriving through direct and paid traffic, suggesting that the landing pages or campaigns might not be aligned with user expectations.

- **Top Performing Channels**:
  - Organic and Referral traffic sources showed the highest session durations, returning visitors, and conversion rates.
  - Referral traffic, in particular, had the highest conversion efficiency, indicating successful content distribution or affiliate partnerships.

- **Geographic Engagement**:
  - Visitors from California and Washington demonstrated the highest levels of engagement, with longer time spent on pages and lower bounce rates.
  - In contrast, users from New York and Florida had shorter sessions and higher bounce rates, suggesting a need for location-specific content optimization.

- **Conversion Opportunities**:
  - Return visits were highest from organic and referral sources, presenting a strong opportunity for retargeting or loyalty-building campaigns.
  - Insights from the dashboard can guide optimization of marketing spend and web content strategy to increase user engagement and conversions.
